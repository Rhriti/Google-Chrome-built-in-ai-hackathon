# NemaR : AI file namer

A filename recommendation system that suggests a suitable filename based on its file content,  leveraging Chrome's built-in AI API.

### Problem statement

Downloading files should be simple, but instead, it’s an everyday frustration. You download a file, and it’s named something utterly meaningless like document(5).pdf or 2020abc123.pdf. Now you’re stuck renaming files, organizing folders, and wasting time on a task that should be effortless.It's a nightmare re-searching these files because of its absured filename.

For professionals like researchers, students, developers, or anyone managing a high volume of downloads, this pain compounds into chaos. Searching for files becomes a nightmare, mistakes creep into workflows, and your digital life gets messier by the day. Worse yet, traditional browsers offer no intelligent solution to help you streamline this process.

Why should we settle for this? Why should a simple file download feel like a chore?

### Solution
